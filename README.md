# Synthetic Mobility Feature Generation for Mental Health Prediction using Diffusion Models

## This repository is a compilation of the methods we presented at Web intelligence 2024.
By using the code here, you can easily generate data based on a small amount of data.
Some of the codes we used in our study have been modified to allow for general use.

## Abstract:
Human mobility patterns are closely linked to mental health status, and various models have been proposed to estimate mental health using mobility data. However, collecting extensive data over long periods remains challenging, often resulting in inadequate training datasets. This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance mobility data features from limited datasets using a diffusion model for synthetic augmentation. Our method involves three key steps: transforming mobility features into images using UMAP for dimensionality reduction, applying a diffusion model to generate new images, and converting these images back into mobility features. Evaluation using location data and QIDS scores from 8 nurses demonstrates significant improvements in model accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity for mental health state estimation. Compared to traditional methods, our approach boosts Accuracy by 4.21%, Precision by 2.32%, Recall by 6.80%, and Specificity by 1.94%. This method offers a practical solution for enhancing data quality in mental health research, particularly useful when mobility data is limited.
